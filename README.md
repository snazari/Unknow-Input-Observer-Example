# Unknow-Input-Observer-Example
An example of the Unknown Input Observer
The Unknown Input Observer (UIO) can be used to decouple state estimates from disturbance signals that may be imparted on the dynamic system of interest. This simple example illustrates the use of the UIO. It is taken from the book: Robust Model Based Fault Diagnosis for Dynamic Systems by J. Chen.
